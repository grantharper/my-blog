Hey all, I have rebuilt my blog for probably the 4th or 5th time. I'm really not sure at this point. Haha. Am I a failure at blogging? Probably, but really I just like wiring things together. And that's what I've done again. Will I once again get bored of this version? Probably. But it's fun right now! And this time, it's practically free since I'm hosting this out of s3 and deploying static files using Jekyll.

And I can't resist using the cool support for code snippets!

{% highlight Java %}
public String sayHello(){
  System.out.println("Hey there!");
}
{% endhighlight %}
