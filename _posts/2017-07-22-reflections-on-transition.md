Two years ago, I sent a very brief email to immediate family members indicating that I had decided to make a big life change. After a great deal of thought and consideration, Bethanie (my wife) and I had decided to no longer participate in the Mormon church.

The back story is long, complicated, and arduous, but suffice it to say that I felt that though I was raised Mormon it just wasn't working for me. It hadn't been for years. I'm not writing this post today to rehash the countless hours that I contemplated the possible options for me to live a happy and fulfilling life. I'm writing this post today to report that two years later, I'm very happy with this choice.

Here's the simple truth: there are a lot of ways to live a happy, fulfilling life. Many people tend to think that their way is the only way, but it's just not true in the slightest. In the end, that's my biggest problem with Mormonism and all religions that claim to be the only way to find true happiness. “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Translation: My way is the only way. Nonsense.

The world is a beautiful place where people approach living in so many different, valid ways. The reason why there are so many religions in the world is not because some evil power is trying to blind us and make it difficult for us to find the one true way. It's simply because we're all different.

There are a lot of improvements to be made in this world, and if religion motivates you to change, that's great! I'm not trying to put anyone down. I'm just trying to make it clear that I feel comfortable with my own internal compass, and I really don't need to be rescued.

To those who see me as someone to be rescued, in the words of Passion Pit, It's not my fault I'm happy. Don't call me crazy, I'm happy.
